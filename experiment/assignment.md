1. Let p = 17, q = 11 and N = pq. If (in the public-key) e= 7, then a possible value for the trap-door d (in the private-key) in an RAS cryptosystem is   
  (a) 22  
  (b) 153  
  (c) 7  
  (d) 23  
	
2. Encrypt the message m = 57 with the textbook RSA with the public key pk = N= 253, e = 3   
   (a)	240  
   (b)	250  
   (c)	257  
   (d)	196  

3. In Asymmetric-Key cipher, the sender uses the _____ key  
   (a) Private  
   (b) Public  
   (c) Either Private or Public  
   (d) None  

4. Understand PKCSv1.5 scheme(using experimetn) and try to break above scheme.     
5. Why PKCSv1.5 is more Secure
