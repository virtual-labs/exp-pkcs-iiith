## Objective

- To understand the PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption scheme and its implementation using RSA
- To demonstrate how RSA encryption works with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding for secure message encryption
- To explore the relationship between RSA key parameters and encryption/decryption operations
- To observe the effect of different key sizes and public exponents on performance
